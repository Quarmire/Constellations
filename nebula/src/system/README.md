# System
A system is an abstraction of a physical network.  It be a star system or an artificial system (without a star), i.e., a personal area network.

A star system is identified by its star.

An artificial system is given a temporary identifier associated with the fleet commander(s) --enabling pervasive peer-to-peer systems to be formed and disbanded.

Stars are network identifiers with individual or organizational association, but they can be left unclaimed.

Unclaimed star systems imply that it is a free system where capital ships can come and go and spaceports answer to no central entity.  Commanders can name the system as they see fit.

To claim a star system, one or more commanders must provide a set of services to the spaceports of the star system.  If more than one commanders lay claim to the system, the system is partitioned; however, the name of the star system must be uniform.  A name change can be proposed but it must be voted on.

Commanders can still name the system as they see fit if they are not interested in interacting with the system administration or using their services.

The set of services that have to be provided by claimants are similar to DCE-RPC:
- Directory Service
- Resource Service
- Security Service
- Time Service
- External Affairs Service

These services allow systems to build a federation of systems.
