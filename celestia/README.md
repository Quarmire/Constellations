# Spaceport - A communication and transport service

A component of Constellations, a distributed knowledge framework

Facilitates the exchange of blocks between celestial bodies by giving ships a place to dock.

Ships: applications
Celestial bodies: user devices
Banks: distributed and authoritative block management
Structures: meaningful collections of blocks
Agents: AI/programs residing in structures providing services

Banks use spaceports to transfer blocks between celestial bodies.
Unmanned ships are a form of block transport.

Crewed ships dock at spaceports to allow the crew to access port facilities and services.

Spaceports have limited communication capabilities with other spaceports.
The communication is instant, but blocks cannot be sent over these links.
Often the link is unusable due to the celestial bodies separation.
These links are often used to communicate with agents on different celestial bodies.

Spaceports are simply interfaces to the facilities of a celestial body.

Spaceports serve as points of settlement on celestial bodies by providing access to the resources of the celestial body.
Structures and facilities can develop around a spaceport over time.

# Implementation
Spaceports are defined in a schema
This determines the capabilities of the spaceport

# More
Spaceports can exist on all celestial bodies (static user devices) or capital ships (mobile user devices).

Celestial bodies rarely move to different systems whereas captial ships often travel between systems.

A spaceport does not have to support extra facilities like holobanks, i.e., comets (embedded devices).
