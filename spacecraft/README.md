- Start TUI with ship name (request for spacecraft by name)
- TUI requests config and state if ship exists (queries ship registry for selected spacecraft)
- TUI applies configuration and state (ship arrival)
- TUI connects to CB facilities i.e. banks (ship docked)

- Ships allows crew to explore cyberspace and expand their star map

- Banks have their own fleet to ship data around.
- Editing blocks on a CB means interacting with the CB's banks.
- These banks are owned by you and have uniform policies unless otherwise defined.

- If crew wants to work on two CBs simultaneously with one ship, there needs to be a warp gate and ship needs to have a warp drive.
- If a warp gate is not present, only one CB can use the ship at a time.
- This is separate from block synchronization performed by banks.
- Ships are for application sync while banks are for data block sync.

- Ships are not just for transport.
- They are your base of operations and hold your tooling.
- They enable you to do heavy work.

- A crew can deposit or withdraw data from a local bank without a ship.

- Once a ship has docked in a CB's spaceport, it has access to the facilities of the CB such as the banks.
- All data blocks created, destroyed, or modified on a CB is done through the permission of your bank system.

- Sometimes, CB lose contact with one another.
- Banks have protocols to handle these situations.
